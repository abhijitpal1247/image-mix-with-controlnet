This project was created to understand and test out features of streamlit.

# Image-mix-with-controlnet
* This repository is an implementation of a streamlit app which provides features of uploading images, 
getting tags/captions/styles from the style image with help of clip-interrogator and generating image which makes use
of soft-edges from content image & styles obtained previously.

For replicating the app in the repo, you can follow these steps:
* git clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/abhijitpal1247/image-mix-with-controlnet.git`
* change the directory to cloned repo `cd image-mix-with-controlnet`
* install the dependencies `pip install -e .`
* run the app through `streamlit run src/app/main.py`

Added a colab notebook to run the streamlit app [(interior_design_trial.ipynb)](https://github.com/abhijitpal1247/image-mix-with-controlnet/blob/main/interior_design_trial.ipynb)
